### 1. **Real-Time Network Traffic Monitoring**
   - **Use Case:** Continuously monitor network traffic for signs of abnormal patterns or malicious activity.
   - **Scenario:** The system monitors network flow events in real-time using logs generated by Suricata and flags any suspicious behavior that could indicate an ongoing attack.

### 2. **DDoS Attack Detection Using Machine Learning**
   - **Use Case:** Detect potential Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks by analyzing network traffic data with a machine learning model.
   - **Scenario:** A surge in traffic from various IP addresses is detected. The system uses the Random Forest Classifier to predict whether the traffic is malicious or benign, allowing for quick action.

### 3. **Automatic IP Blocking for Threat Mitigation**
   - **Use Case:** Block malicious IP addresses detected as part of a DDoS attack to prevent further damage to the network.
   - **Scenario:** Once an IP is flagged by the system as part of an attack, the `block_ip()` function automatically blocks that IP address using `iptables`, reducing the attack's impact.

### 4. **Traffic Anomaly Detection in Enterprise Networks**
   - **Use Case:** Identify unusual patterns in network traffic that could signal the start of a cyberattack, such as a DDoS or infiltration attempt.
   - **Scenario:** During a busy time for an organization’s web servers, traffic spikes from certain IP ranges are detected, and the system classifies these as anomalies, prompting further investigation.

### 5. **Proactive Network Defense for Critical Services**
   - **Use Case:** Enhance the security of critical infrastructure by proactively identifying and blocking potential attack vectors.
   - **Scenario:** A government agency or financial institution deploys the system to monitor traffic for any malicious activity targeting their public-facing services. The system automatically blocks suspicious IPs, ensuring uptime and security.

### 6. **Machine Learning-Based Security Enhancements**
   - **Use Case:** Continuously improve the detection of attacks by retraining the machine learning model with new traffic data.
   - **Scenario:** The organization updates the model periodically with new traffic data (e.g., after a DDoS attack) to enhance its predictive accuracy for future threats, ensuring the system stays up-to-date.

### 7. **Integration with Security Operations Centers (SOC)**
   - **Use Case:** Provide security teams with real-time insights into network threats by integrating with existing SOC tools.
   - **Scenario:** Security analysts receive alerts and logs when the system detects suspicious traffic or blocks an IP. This data is used to conduct further investigation or enhance other defense mechanisms.

### 8. **Web Application for Threat Prediction and Analysis**
   - **Use Case:** Provide a web interface for real-time analysis and prediction of network traffic to identify attacks.
   - **Scenario:** A network administrator submits traffic data via the Flask web application, which predicts whether the traffic is normal or part of an attack, providing insights into ongoing network conditions.

These use cases highlight the system’s capabilities in real-time monitoring, automated response, and leveraging machine learning to enhance network security against DDoS attacks.                - This function reads a JSON log file generated by Suricata (an open-source network threat detection engine) line by line.
  - It detects flow events and prints the source and destination IP addresses for each detected flow.
  - If there’s an error while reading the log, it captures and prints the error message.

### 2. **Machine Learning Model Training**
- **Libraries Used:** pandas, sklearn
- **Process:**
  - Loads a dataset (CICDDoS2019.csv) that contains features of network traffic and corresponding labels (normal or attack).
  - Preprocesses the data by separating features and labels.
  - Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Trains a Random Forest Classifier using the training data and evaluates its accuracy on the test data.
  - Saves the trained model to a file (ddos_model.pkl) for future use.

### 3. **IP Blocking**
- **Function:** block_ip(ip_address)
  - This function takes an IP address and executes a shell command to block the IP using iptables.
  - It handles any potential errors when executing the command and prints appropriate messages.

### 4. **Web Application for Predictions**
- **Framework Used:** Flask
- **Functionality:**
  - Sets up a simple web server that loads the pre-trained model.
  - Defines a route (/predict) to handle POST requests where it expects traffic data.
  - It uses the model to predict whether the traffic is normal or an attack and returns the prediction in JSON format.

### 5. **Execution**
- In the main block, the script calls the monitor_traffic function to start monitoring logs.
- It demonstrates how to block a list of example IP addresses.
